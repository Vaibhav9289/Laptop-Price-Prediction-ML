Laptop Price Prediction Model Using Python and Linear Regression

Developed a laptop price prediction model leveraging Python and linear regression techniques. Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization to understand data patterns and distributions. Prepared the dataset for machine learning by cleaning and transforming the data. Experimented with three model variations:

#### Normal Prices: Predicted prices using original price values.

#### Log Prices: Applied logarithmic transformation to prices for normalization.

#### Optimized Log Prices: Removed statistically insignificant and inter-correlated variables, achieving an 85% accuracy rate.


## Achieved optimal performance with the third model, demonstrating the importance of feature selection and transformation in improving model accuracy.
